            <p>“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal
                truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends
                - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through
                everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best
                friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of
                them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if
                you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that
                goes for everything.”
